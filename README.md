# Stm32-Ethernet-Demo
This project is a proving ground for developing STM32 Firmware to use Ethernet. Here I would like to implement responses to a few LAN messages to enable an RPie to communicate with and Stm32 

# Goals
Create all the register level firmware from scratch without any auto generated init code. 

Create a defensivly programmed abstraction layer on top of the STM32 registers

Implement functionality to respond to ping messages from an RPie.

Create a two way text chat between a Python program and an Rpie
